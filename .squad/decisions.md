# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Game Architecture (McManus)
**Date:** 2026-06-03  
**Status:** Implemented

Complete beat 'em up game with modular ES6 architecture and no external dependencies. Fixed timestep (60 FPS), Canvas 2D renderer with camera system, keyboard state management, Web Audio API sound effects. Entity-component pattern for Player and AI enemies with state machines. Combat uses rectangle collision detection, knockback physics, hitstun. Wave-based progression with camera locks. All graphics procedurally drawn via Canvas API. File structure: index.html + styles.css for entry, src/engine/entities/systems/scenes/ui/ for modules.

**Why:** Simplicity (no frameworks), modularity (clean separation), performance (fixed timestep), and satisfying combat feedback (screen shake, knockback, hitstun).

### Core Gameplay Bug Fixes (Keaton)
**Date:** 2024  
**Status:** Implemented

Five critical bugs fixed:
1. **Input infinite recursion** — Renamed duplicate `isDown()` to `isMovingDown()` to prevent stack overflow
2. **Hit detection unreliability** — Moved `Combat.handlePlayerAttack()` to run every frame with `attackHitList` Set to prevent multi-hits
3. **Damage loop** — Added 500ms invulnerability frames (`invulnTime`) with blink effect for visual feedback
4. **Parallax direction** — Changed background scroll from 1.3x to 0.3x for proper depth perception
5. **Left boundary** — Added player boundary check `Math.max(player.x, cameraX + 10)` to keep player visible

**Why:** Surgical fixes to make game playable. Each addressed a specific bug without rewriting systems. Hit tracking and i-frames follow standard beat 'em up patterns.

### Team Expansion (Solo/Keaton, Lead)
**Date:** 2026-06-03  
**Status:** Implemented

Complete squad expansion from 4 core roles (Solo, Chewie, Lando, Wedge) to 9-member cross-game development team. VFX/Art Specialist (Boba) confirmed. Three new roles added:
- **Greedo (Sound Designer):** Owns Web Audio API expertise, procedural SFX library, music generation system. 7 backlog items (2×P0, 2×P1, 1×P2, 2×P3). Frees Chewie from audio work. Cross-game value: ★★★★★ (sound toolkit compounds across all projects).
- **Tarkin (Enemy/Content Dev):** Owns enemy AI, boss design, wave composition, pickups, difficulty scaling. 14 backlog items (1×P1, 6×P2, 7×P3). Reduces Lando from 26→12 items. Works in parallel on content while Lando builds player systems.
- **Ackbar (QA/Playtester):** Owns testing, balance tuning, feel verification across all items. Develops calibrated instincts for hitbox fairness, combo timing, input responsiveness. Cross-game value: ★★★★☆ (feel tuning expertise compounds).

Revised load distribution eliminates McManus bottleneck, enables parallel workstreams (Engine/Gameplay/Content/Presentation).

**Why:** Gap analysis on 52-item backlog revealed structural overload: Lando carrying 50%, Chewie juggling audio + engine. Three new roles distribute work, enable parallelism, and build compounding cross-game expertise.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
