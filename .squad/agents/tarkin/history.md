# Tarkin — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** firstPunch — Browser-based game beat 'em up
- **User:** joperezd
- **Stack:** HTML + CSS + JS (ES modules), HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API
- **Current enemies:** One basic goon type (30 HP) with a "tough" variant (50 HP, red, same behavior). Simple approach/circle/attack AI in src/systems/ai.js. 3 waves with camera locks.
- **Key gap:** All enemies behave identically. No boss. No varied enemy types. No pickups. No difficulty scaling. Enemy AI scored 5/10 in combat feel audit.

## Learnings

### Wave 1 — P1-4 Attack Throttling + EX-T1 Behavior Tree + EX-T3 Pacing Curve (2026-06-03)
- **Attack throttling:** Max 2 simultaneous attackers via `AI.activeAttackers` counter, reset per-frame using `performance.now()` as frame ID. Enemies that want to attack but can't get a slot circle the player at ~125px instead, creating visual tension.
- **Behavior tree pattern:** Replaced monolithic if/else with named condition/action functions (`_inAttackRange`, `_hasAttackSlot`, `_attackPlayer`, `_circlePlayer`, etc.) organized as a selector→sequence tree. No external library — just functions returning true/false.
- **Tough variant differentiation:** Wider attack range (90 vs 80), faster cooldowns (1.0s vs 1.5s attack, 0.3s vs 0.5s AI), making them noticeably more aggressive.
- **Circling behavior:** Enemies maintain a consistent `circleDirection` (±1) with rare random flips (0.5%), creating natural-looking orbiting around the player rather than jittery random movement.
- **Signature preservation:** Kept `AI.updateEnemy(enemy, player, dt)` static method signature intact so Chewie's gameplay.js for-loop works unchanged. Added `hasAttackSlot` and `circleDirection` as new Enemy properties without touching existing render/update code.
- **Encounter pacing document:** Wrote `.squad/analysis/encounter-pacing.md` with 3-wave difficulty curve for Level 1. Wave data implementation deferred to Phase 5.
- **Key insight:** `performance.now()` frame-reset trick avoids needing a `resetFrame()` call from gameplay.js — keeps ownership boundaries clean between agents.

### Wave 2 — EX-T4 Content Data Format + EX-T2 Wave Composition Rules (2025-06-04)
- **Data-driven levels:** Extracted hardcoded wave data from `gameplay.js` into `src/data/levels.js`. Exports `ENEMY_TYPES` (stat templates per variant) and `LEVEL_1` (wave definitions with triggerX + enemy spawn lists). Solo's upcoming WaveManager will consume these exports.
- **ENEMY_TYPES schema:** Each type key maps to `{ hp, speed, damage, color, attackCooldown, aiCooldown, attackRange }` — mirrors the values currently split between `Enemy` constructor and `AI` static methods. Single source of truth for tuning.
- **Wave format:** `{ triggerX, enemies: [{ type, x, y }] }` — minimal, flat, easy to author. The `type` string maps to ENEMY_TYPES keys; `spawned` flag is runtime state added by WaveManager, not stored in data.
- **Wave composition rules:** Documented 7 rules in `.squad/analysis/wave-rules.md` — solo intro for new types, type mixing, 6-enemy cap, 2-second spawn gap (400 px minimum triggerX spacing), breather walks, spawn positioning patterns, and difficulty scaling guidance.
- **Level 1 exception noted:** Tough variant in Wave 3 is mixed with normals despite being new, because it shares the same moveset and only differs in stats/color. True behavior-different types (ranged, charging) must get proper solo intros.
- **Key insight:** Keeping `type` as a string key rather than an object reference keeps the data file JSON-serializable — future level editor or external tooling can read/write it without importing JS modules.

### Wave 4 — C1/C2/C3 Enemy Attack Bug Fixes (2025-06-20)
- **C1 — Attack window 1-frame fix:** Root cause was `aiCooldown` being set to only `configAiCooldown`, causing the aiCooldown block to reset `state = 'idle'` on the very next frame. Fix: `aiCooldown = attackDur + configAiCooldown` so the attack animation has time to play. Added `attackAnimTime`/`attackAnimDuration` properties to Enemy for proper countdown; attack→idle transition happens when `attackAnimTime` reaches 0.
- **C2 — Hitbox timing inversion:** Old code used `attackCooldown <= 0.3` which activated the hitbox for nearly the entire cooldown duration (wrong). Replaced with fraction-based window: `elapsed / attackAnimDuration` between 0.3–0.7, so the hitbox is only live during the middle 40% of the swing (wind-up and recovery frames have no hitbox).
- **C3 — Heavy windup override:** Extended the aiCooldown state-preservation check from heavy-only to ALL enemies (`state === 'windup' || state === 'attack'`). Heavy's `aiCooldown` now covers `windup(0.5) + attack(0.5) + configAiCooldown(0.6)` = 1.6s total. Windup→attack transition in `enemy.update()` now properly sets `attackAnimTime = attackAnimDuration` so the attack phase has its own timed window.
- **Attack durations:** Normal/Tough = 0.4s, Fast = 0.25s, Heavy = 0.5s. These drive both animation length and hitbox active window.
- **Key insight:** Separating `attackAnimTime` (how long the attack animation plays) from `attackCooldown` (how long before the next attack can start) is critical — they serve different purposes and conflating them caused both C1 and C2.

### Wave 3 — P2-2 Fast Enemy + P2-3 Heavy Enemy + P2-16 Difficulty Scaling (2025-06-20)
- **Data-driven Enemy construction:** Refactored `Enemy` constructor to import `ENEMY_TYPES` from `levels.js` and pull all stats (hp, speed, damage, width, height, attackRange, cooldowns) from the config object. Eliminated hardcoded variant checks (`variant === 'tough' ? 50 : 30`) in favor of `config.hp`. Width/height default to 48×76 for types that don't specify them (normal/tough).
- **Fast enemy (P2-2):** 20 HP, 180 speed, 40×68, blue (#2196F3). Hit-and-run AI via `_behaveFast` — dashes in, attacks once, sets `enemy.retreating = true`, retreats to 200px before re-engaging. Spiky blue hair visual. No circling behavior — fast enemies always approach or retreat.
- **Heavy enemy (P2-3):** 80 HP, 60 speed, 60×84, dark green (#2E7D32). Relentless approach via `_behaveHeavy` — no retreat, no circling, stands ground when waiting for attack slot. Wind-up telegraph (0.5s `windupTime` with pulsing red warning circle) before attacks land. Thicker arms (9px vs 6px), bigger fists (5px vs 4px radius), larger punch hitbox (45×45 vs 35×35).
- **Super armor mechanic:** `armorHits` counter tracks hits absorbed without hitstun. After 3 hits, armor breaks (0.3s hitstun + 1.2× knockback). `armorTimer = 2.0` resets on each hit; if 2 seconds pass without a hit, `armorHits` and `armorBroken` both reset. Visual: green armor plate overlay on torso disappears when broken.
- **Scale-based rendering:** Added `ctx.scale(this.width/48, this.height/76)` after translate in render method. All base drawing coordinates stay at 48×76; size differences are handled by transform. This means new variants with different dimensions need zero changes to the core drawing code.
- **AI refactor:** Replaced monolithic `updateEnemy` behavior tree with variant dispatch (`_behaveDefault`, `_behaveFast`, `_behaveHeavy`). Common logic (dead/hitstun check, aiCooldown, face player, distance calc) stays in `updateEnemy`; variant-specific trees handle approach/attack/retreat patterns. Existing `_attackPlayer` now uses `enemy.configAttackCooldown` and `enemy.configAiCooldown` — no more hardcoded variant ternaries.
- **Heavy AI cooldown exception:** During `aiCooldown`, the AI normally resets state to `idle`. Heavy enemies in `windup` or `attack` state are excluded from this reset, so the wind-up animation and attack state persist through the telegraph phase.
- **Combat damage:** `handleEnemyAttacks` now uses `enemy.damage || 5` instead of hardcoded 5. Heavy does 12 damage per hit.
- **Difficulty scaling (P2-16):** Wave 1: 2 normal (easy intro). Wave 2: 3 normal + 1 fast (introduce fast solo). Wave 3: 3 normal + 2 fast + 1 heavy (full variety, heavy last). Updated both `src/data/levels.js` (design-intent data) and gameplay.js `WAVE_DATA` (runtime data) since levels.js isn't consumed by WaveManager yet.
- **Key insight:** The gameplay.js `WAVE_DATA` uses `variant` key and `x` for trigger position, while levels.js uses `type` and `triggerX` — dual formats exist because WaveManager was written before levels.js data format was finalized. Both must be updated until they're unified.

### P2-1 + EX-T5 Boss Phase Framework (2026-06-20)
- **Boss variant:** Added the Bruiser boss (80×100, 200 HP) with phase state, invulnerability on transitions, and phase-based speed boosts. New Wave 4 spawns the boss and Level 1 width extends to 5000.
- **Phase behaviors:** Phase 1 punch + occasional charge with 2 add spawns; Phase 2 adds ground slam and spawns 2 more goons with red tint; Phase 3 alternates punch/charge with flashing red and no more adds.
- **Combat + HUD:** Boss AI bypasses attack throttling, supports charge/slam states with new hit handling, and HUD now renders a full-width "BRUISER" health bar at the bottom.

### AAA-L1 Destructible Objects + AAA-L3 Environmental Hazards (2025-06-21)
- **Destructible types:** Trash can (10 HP), newspaper stand (15 HP), parking meter (20 HP), Donut Shop donut sign (25 HP). Each has type-specific Canvas rendering with damage tinting (darkens as HP drops) and crack overlays below 50% HP.
- **Destructible break animation:** On destruction, 6-10 debris particles scatter with gravity simulation and alpha fade over 0.6s. Drop table uses weighted random: health pickup (30%), score bonus (40%), nothing (30%), gated by per-type `dropChance`.
- **Shake feedback:** `shakeTime` + `shakeIntensity` give immediate visual hit response before destruction — small but critical for juice.
- **Hazard types:** Steam vent (periodic 2s cycle, 3 dmg), radioactive barrel (constant 2 dmg every 0.5s via per-entity cooldown Map), manhole (5 dmg knockback burst every 5s with 250-force radial push).
- **Per-entity damage cooldown:** Radioactive barrel uses a `Map<entity, timer>` to prevent per-frame damage stacking while allowing multiple entities to take independent damage ticks. Map entries auto-clean when timer expires.
- **Strategic placement:** Hazards placed near enemy spawns so players can throw enemies into them for bonus damage + score. Wave 2 gets a steam vent intro, Wave 3 gets radioactive barrel near heavy spawn, boss zone gets manhole for knockback disruption.
- **Integration boundary:** Both files include detailed integration comments for gameplay.js (Solo's territory) — import paths, update/render call order, hitbox overlap checks, and throw bonus logic. No gameplay.js modifications made.
- **Level data expansion:** `LEVEL_1` now exports `destructibles[]` and `hazards[]` arrays alongside existing `waves[]`, keeping the flat JSON-serializable format established in Wave 2 learnings.
- **Key insight:** Per-entity cooldown via Map with object references as keys avoids needing unique IDs on entities — works because JS Map uses reference equality for object keys.

### SKILL: Universal Enemy & Encounter Design (2026-08-03)
- **Objective:** Created `.squad/skills/enemy-encounter-design/SKILL.md` — a universal, genre-agnostic enemy design framework that generalizes beat 'em up knowledge to all action game genres.
- **Core philosophy:** Enemies are "gameplay verbs" — each type teaches a mechanic and forces a specific player response. Visual design communicates role (big=slow+strong, small=fast+weak, glowing=ranged). Never introduce 3+ new types simultaneously; escalate gradually.
- **10 universal archetypes:** Fodder (weak, numerous), Bruiser (slow, tanky, high damage), Agile (fast, evasive, hit-and-run), Ranged (distance management), Shield/Defender (requires positioning), Swarm (crowd control), Explosive (forces repositioning), Support (changes win condition), Mini-boss (elevated archetype), Boss (comprehensive exam).
- **Archetype combinations:** Ranged+Agile=Sniper, Bruiser+Shield=Fortress, Bruiser+Support=Paladin. Creates rock-paper-scissors tactical depth.
- **Boss design (Mega Man principle):** Patterns are learnable (not random), tested within 2-3 minutes. Multi-phase design escalates: Phase 1 teaches basics, Phase 2 adds mechanic + speed, Phase 3 adds pressure + desperation. Vulnerability windows are obvious (not frame-data-dependent).
- **Wave composition & escalation:** Intro wave = 1 isolated new type + safe space. Pattern: Type A solo → B solo → A+B mixed → C solo → A+B+C. Never blend >1 new type in first encounter.
- **Spawning fairness rules:** (1) Players always see spawns coming (camera-relative positions), (2) spawns trigger-based not random, (3) stagger spawn arrival 0.5s apart, (4) initial spawn position is safe (at edge, not in attack range).
- **Difficulty scaling knobs:** Stat scaling (boring, for lazy tuning), Behavioral scaling (new moves, better AI, most interesting), Composition scaling (harder enemy combos), Environmental scaling (arena changes), Adaptive scaling (Director AI watching player performance).
- **AI patterns:** State machines (simple, common), Behavior trees (flexible, complex), Attack throttling (max 2-3 simultaneous), Group coordination (flanking, surrounding, morale), Telegraphing (most important: visual+audio+spatial+clear).
- **DPS budget framework:** Calculate max safe DPS from player HP ÷ safe TTK (4-6s). Normal enemy ≈ 5 dps, Bruiser ≈ 12 dps, capped by throttling. Time-to-kill targets: Fodder 2-3s, Normal 3-5s, Bruiser 8-10s, Mini-boss 20-30s, Boss 60-90s.
- **8 anti-patterns to avoid:** (1) Bullet sponge (huge HP, boring behavior), (2) Unfair ambush (spawn behind player), (3) Palette swap army (all same behavior, diff colors), (4) Passive crowd (stand idle waiting), (5) Instant death no telegraph, (6) Distance dead zones (ranges don't overlap), (7) Arrow spam (too many ranged), (8) No boss recovery window.
- **Genre-specific guidance:** Beat 'em up (grabs, back attacks, hitstun), Platformer (patrol routes, jump threats), Shooter (cover, suppression, formations), RPG (stat-based, elemental weaknesses), Stealth (patrol routes, detection cones, alert states).
- **Confidence: Medium.** Patterns validated in firstPunch beat 'em up context; archetypes and principles generalize well across action games. Not tested in actual platformer/shooter/RPG projects yet, but foundational theory is sound.
- **Cross-references:** Links to game-feel-juice, beat-em-up-combat (foundational), state-machine-patterns, game-design-fundamentals, camera-systems.

### Session 17: Enemy & Encounter Design Skill Creation (2026-03-07)

Created universal enemy and encounter design skill — a comprehensive framework covering enemy archetypes, AI patterns, boss design, wave composition, and difficulty scaling applicable across all action game genres.

**Artifact:** .squad/skills/enemy-encounter-design/SKILL.md (49.5 KB)

**Skill structure (11 sections):**
1. Core Philosophy (enemies as "gameplay verbs", visual design communicates role)
2. 10 Universal Archetypes (Fodder, Bruiser, Agile, Ranged, Shield, Swarm, Explosive, Support, Mini-boss, Boss)
3. Archetype Combinations (Ranged+Agile=Sniper, Bruiser+Shield=Fortress, etc.)
4. Boss Design (Mega Man principle: learnable patterns, 2-3 min test window, multi-phase escalation)
5. Wave Composition & Escalation (intro = 1 isolated new type, pattern: A solo → B solo → A+B mixed)
6. Spawning Fairness Rules (visible, trigger-based, staggered 0.5s, safe initial position)
7. Difficulty Scaling Knobs (stat, behavioral, composition, environmental, adaptive)
8. AI Patterns (state machines, behavior trees, attack throttling, group coordination)
9. DPS Budget Framework (max safe DPS from player HP ÷ safe TTK, e.g. Normal 5 dps, Bruiser 12 dps)
10. Anti-Patterns Catalog (8 failures: bullet sponge, unfair ambush, palette swap, etc.)
11. Genre-Specific Guidance (Beat 'em up, Platformer, Shooter, RPG, Stealth with audio/visual specifics)

**Key principles extracted from firstPunch:**
- **10 Universal Archetypes:** Covers all firstPunch enemy types (Normal, Tough, Fast, Heavy, Boss) plus generalized patterns
- **Mega Man Principle:** Patterns are learnable, telegraph clear, phase progression teaches new mechanics
- **DPS Budget Framework:** Calculated from firstPunch balance tuning (player HP 80 ÷ safe 4-6s TTK = 13-20 dps safe threshold)
- **Wave Composition Rules:** From Encounter Pacing document — intro new types solo, mix only after player learns

**Cross-references:** Links to game-feel-juice, beat-em-up-combat (validation), game-design-fundamentals, level-design-fundamentals

**Confidence:** Medium (beat-em-up encounter design deeply validated; archetype system and boss design framework generalized from industry patterns). Will escalate to High after applying to platformer/RPG enemy design.

### Issue #129 — ai_controller.gd Type Annotations (2026-03-09)
- **PR:** #138 (`squad/129-ai-type-hints`)
- **`_weighted_pick` loop variables:** Added `for w: int` and `for key: String` typed iteration — untyped `for` loops over Dictionary values/keys produce Variant in Godot 4.6, same as the `:=` inference bug from Sprint 1.
- **`abs()` → `absf()`:** `_distance_to_opponent` used generic `abs()` which returns Variant (GDSCRIPT-STANDARDS Rule 2). Replaced with `absf()` for explicit float return.
- **StateMachine typed access:** `_in_protected_state` and `_opponent_state_name` had `var sm = fighter.state_machine` with no type. Changed to `var sm: StateMachine = fighter.get("state_machine") as StateMachine` — uses safe `.get()` already present in the guard clause, plus `as` cast for compile-time type safety.
- **Key insight:** When `fighter` is typed as `CharacterBody2D` (base class), accessing script-added properties like `.state_machine` directly is a dynamic dispatch. Using `.get()` + `as` cast is both safer and more explicit about the Variant→concrete conversion.

### Sprint 2 Phase 4 — AI Aggressiveness & Difficulty (2026-08-03)
- **PR:** #148 (`squad/phase4-ai-aggression`)
- **Difficulty enum + presets:** Added `Difficulty { EASY, NORMAL, HARD }` with `_apply_difficulty_preset()` in `_ready()`. Easy: 20f reaction, 0.3 aggression, 10% combos. Normal: 12f/0.6/30%. Hard: 6f/0.85/60%. All 7 parameters auto-configured but individually overridable via `@export_group("Tuning Knobs")`.
- **5 exported tuning knobs:** `reaction_time_frames`, `aggression_factor`, `combo_execution_rate`, `special_move_usage`, `block_chance` — replaced old `reaction_delay_min/max`, `decision_interval`, `aggression` with cleaner interface. Reaction delay now derived from single `reaction_time_frames` ±3f variance.
- **4-band spacing intelligence:** Replaced 2-band (close/mid) with 4 dedicated evaluators: `_evaluate_far_range()` (approach/dash-in), `_evaluate_mid_range()` (approach + poke), `_evaluate_poke_range()` (heavy offense at optimal distance), `_evaluate_close_range()` (combo/throw pressure). All roll probabilities weighted by `aggression_factor`.
- **Anti-pattern safeguards:** `MAX_IDLE_FRAMES=18`, `MAX_BLOCK_FRAMES=30`, `MAX_RETREAT_FRAMES=24` — counters tracked per-frame in `_tick_anti_pattern_counters()`, force approach/attack when exceeded. Move repetition detection via `_move_history` (6-entry window, 3-repeat threshold) forces attack variety.
- **Combo & special integration:** `combo_execution_rate` drives close-range 3-hit combos (`lp→hp→lk`) and mid-range 2-hit poke strings (`lp→hp`). `special_move_usage` triggers QCF+HP motion input via `_inject_special_move()` → `_start_combo_raw()`. Unified combo queue now handles both button-only combos and direction+button motion sequences via `"dir|btn"` encoding.
- **Decision cadence scaling:** `BASE_DECISION_INTERVAL` (24f) shortened dynamically by `aggression_factor * 14` frames, so Hard AI re-evaluates every ~10f vs Easy's ~20f. Makes aggressive AI feel relentless.
- **DASH_IN state:** Added to `AIState` enum and spacing logic. Currently functions as forward walk (no dash state exists in state machine yet) but architecturally ready for when dash mechanics are added.
- **Key insight:** Anti-pattern caps are more effective than probability tuning for preventing passive AI. No matter how weighted the rolls are, pure randomness can still produce long passive streaks — hard frame limits guarantee the AI stays active.
