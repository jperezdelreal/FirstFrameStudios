# Decision: AudioContext Resume Pattern

**Author:** Greedo  
**Date:** 2025-06-04  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
Web Audio API requires a user gesture before AudioContext can produce sound. The previous code created the context eagerly in the constructor, meaning audio could silently fail on first load in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

## Decision
- AudioContext is still created in the constructor (so `currentTime` etc. are available immediately)
- A `resume()` method checks `context.state === 'suspended'` and calls `context.resume()`
- `main.js` registers a one-time `keydown`/`click` listener that calls `audio.resume()` and removes itself
- All existing `playX()` methods continue to work without changes — they just produce no sound until the context is resumed

## Why
- Transparent fix: zero changes to any caller code
- One-time listener self-removes to avoid unnecessary event handling
- Works across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- The title screen requires ENTER to start, so audio is always resumed before gameplay begins

## Trade-offs
- If a caller tries to play sound before any user interaction, it silently does nothing (acceptable — matches browser behavior)
- Could alternatively lazy-create the context on first `resume()`, but that would delay `currentTime` baseline — not worth the complexity
